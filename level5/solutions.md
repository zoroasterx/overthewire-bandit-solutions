**Goal**: Find the human-readable file among multiple files with binary data.

## Concepts:
**`file`**: Determines the file type by analizing its content.

Sometimes files in Linux may not have extensions or could be disguised. `file` reveals their true nature. 

`*`: Matches any number of characters in filenames

Use cases: 

`ls *` : Lists all files

`file ./*` : Check all files
